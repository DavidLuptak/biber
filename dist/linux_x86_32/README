Install Par, Par::Packer (must be >=1.007)
  Make sure that when Par::Packer is installed that the right libperl gets picked up
  If there is a default linux install of perl where libperl is in a
  standard place like /usr/lib, it'll likely get used and hard-coded into
  pp on compile.
Update Unicode::Collate to latest version
Install Biber and all dependencies
Run the "build.sh" build script

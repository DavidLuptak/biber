The binary distributions of biber are made using the perl PAR::Packer "pp"
utility. They can be used as a normal binary but have some behaviour which
is worth noting:

* On the first run of a new version (that is, with a specific checksum),
  they actually unpack themselves to a temporary location. This varies by
  operating system but is usually something like /var/tmp or /tmp on
  UNIX-based OSes and C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local
  Settings\Temp on Windows. This unpacking can take a little while and only
  happens on the first run of a new version.
* The initial unpacking (first run) can give odd warnings/errors about
  permissions which can be ignored. Simply run biber once to unpack it and
  after the first run, you will see no warnings/errors and startup time
  will dramatically improve.


Please rename the appropriate OS/arch version to just "biber" after
download.

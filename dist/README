The binary distributions of biber are made using the perl PAR::Packer "pp"
utility. They can be used as a normal binary but have some behaviour which
is worth noting:

* Don't be worried by the size of the binaries. PAR::Packer essentially
  constructs a self-extracting archive which unpacks the needed files first
  and so the binaries look larger than what actually runs in memory.
* On the first run of a new version (that is, with a specific checksum),
  they actually unpack themselves to a temporary location. This varies by
  operating system but is usually something like /var/tmp or /tmp on
  UNIX-based OSes and C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local
  Settings\Temp on Windows. This unpacking can take a little while and only
  happens on the first run of a new version.
* The initial unpacking (first run) can give odd warnings/errors about
  permissions which can be ignored. Simply run biber once to unpack it and
  after the first run, you will see no warnings/errors and startup time
  will dramatically improve.
* This is a command-line program, as biber always was and so you run it
  from the command-line just as you do with the perl-based biber.

Distributions
-------------
linux_x86_32     - Linux x86 32-bit (built on Ubuntu 10.04)
linux_x86_64     - Linux x86 64-bit (built on Ubuntu 10.04)
MSWin            - Windows. Should work on 32 or 64 bit (built on XP)
darwin_x86_64    - OSX Intel 64-bit (built on OSX 10.6)


Installing
-----------
Download the binary appropriate to you OS/arch. Below I assume it's on your desktop.
Rename the binary to just "biber".

You have to move the binary to somewhere in you command-line or TeX utility
path so that it can be found. If you know how to do this, just ignore the
section which contains some instructions for users who are not sure about this.


OSX
---
If you are using the TexLive MacTeX distribution:

sudo mv ~/Desktop/biber /usr/texbin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/texbin/biber

If you are using the macports TexLive distribution:

sudo mv ~/Desktop/biber /opt/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /opt/local/bin/biber

The "sudo" commands will prompt you for you password.

Windows
-------
The easiest way is to just move the executable in your c:\Windows directory since
that is always in your path.

A more elegant solution if you are using Strawberry perl, assumed below to
be in c:\strawberry, move the biber executable into c:\strawberry\perl\site\bin\biber

You may have to create the folder c:\strawberry\perl\site\bin if it does
not exist. You should also add c:\strawberry\perl\site\bin to your PATH if
it is not already in there. If you don't know how to set the PATH
environment variable, search Google for "set PATH Windows" - there are many
pages about this. Here's one that describes Windows 7 but it's the same for
XP, 2000 and Vista:

Unix
----
sudo mv ~/Desktop/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/biber

Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH. Search Google for "set PATH
linux" if unsure about this. There are many pages about this, for example:

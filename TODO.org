* When perl 5.16.1 is released, move build farm to this and:
** Convert lc() compares to fc()
** use v5.16 everywhere
* Forms
** Documentation
*** form arg for field in sortspecs (biblatex and biber)
*** not relevant for date/url datatypes
** fields need two optional arguments for form and lang in bbl, by default empty for backwards compat
** labelnamespec, labeltitlespec need to specify which form
** Potential issues
*** You can sort on one form of a name/title but labelname/labeltitle could cause labels to be generated from another form? One way to avoid is to specify a labelname form and then to sort on labelname?

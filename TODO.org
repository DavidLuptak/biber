* TODO labelalphatemplate implementation
  * list disambiguation for la
  * Document new la stuff for la=1, extraalpha/year/singletitle are regenerated for every list dynamically. format for counters
  * Take out labelalphatemplate defaults, optional in rnc/rng and parsing when biblatex implements it
  * Moving over to the new labelalpha code means taking out la=1 completely and also removing
    extraalpha which will be dealt with in the new la template code instead.

* TODO When cygwin on perl 5.14, change build script (deprecated module)

* TODO When biblatex implements related entries, take out reprinttitle

* TODO Generalised \printbibliography system
  * Typed lists - entry, key, shorthand etc.
  * Take out MAIN, SHORTHANDS backwards compat hacks in Biber.pm and BBL.pm
  * Shorthands should be requested otherwise it's a big sorting overhead

* TODO Structure ALL fields need to be put into types where possible

* TODO Displaymodes should not be optional in schema and control parse when implemented

* TODO Zotero data sources
  * Change Zotero driver when 2.2 comes out with real keys
  * Zotero ATOM API? http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/start
    [[https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items/<ITEMID>?key=<APIKEY>]]
    gives a parseable ATOM XML with the information but it's ugly
    [[https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items?key=<APIKEY>]] give all entries

* TODO uniquename needs changing everywhere if middlename is implemented

* DONE biblatex firstinits option to giveninits
* DONE useprefix per names/name?
* DONE More flexible sorting allowing arbitrary name part order?
* DONE name taxonomy (first, middle, last) needs to be generalised. Internally in Biber too
** firstname -> given
** lastname -> family
** middlename -> middle
** prefix -> prefix
** suffix -> suffix
* DONE lastname mandatory relaxed? How about just mandatory that some part is defined since sorting isn't always on lastname first?
* DONE name parts and gender types in data model as constants
* DONE \keypart round \namepart
* DONE make namepart specs
** DONE named
** DONE selectable per sortlist
*** TODO abx@aux@sortscheme etc. probably this needs to be generalised to mentioned refcontexts
** DONE per-entry
** DONE per-namelist, per name
* DONE hashes use static construction from DM name constants - problem with uniquelist
* DONE tool mode bltx output should write schema but controlled by option (normal output uses same option)
* DONE per-names/name options are not in .bcf - matters?
* DONE per-namelists/per-name options
** DONE needs per names/name support in biblatex and in bbl
** DONE sortnamekeyscheme needs per entry/names/name in bbl
** DONE biblatex macro support in formats for sortnamekeyscheme
** DONE What to do with gender attribute on name?
* DONE Document example in biblatex manual of compound keypart
* DONE implement patronymic namepart example
* DONE Document year/month (datepart fields) are not allowed in bltxml
* TODO Transliteration interface
** sorttlit|t=s (from:to)
** showtlit (construct quick U::T object, list->pairs();
** Incompatible with fastsort
** This option needs to be available everywhere locale is.

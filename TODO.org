* Multiscript
** Document that maps must specify form/lang, there is no auto mapping of all field variants. This would be messy at best.
** Inidividual name hashes are different between variants - does this matter?
** Get rid of origtitle, origpublisher, origlocation?
** Tool mode stuff - does it account for ms?
* New tool mode option for output type
* Biblatexml output
** form/lang should be output
* Docs - not all tool mode options are relevant for all output types, table in docs saying which does what
* Sample XSLT transform but not in biber
* bltxml either should have no schema or it should be dynamically created from the data model. A static schema is pointless

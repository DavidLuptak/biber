* When perl 5.16.1 is released, move build farm to this and:
** Convert lc() compares to fc()
** use v5.16 everywhere
* Multiscript
** Document that maps must specify form/lang, there is no auto mapping of all field variants. This would be messy at best.
** Inidividual name hashes are different between variants - does this matter?

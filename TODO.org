* org names (bltxml)
* name taxonomy (first, middle, last) needs to be generalised. Internally in Biber too
** firstname -> given
** lastname -> family
** middlename -> middle
** prefix -> prefix
** suffix -> suffix
* year/month (datepart fields) are not allowed in bltxml
* name parts should be defined in data model and nothing hard-coded?
* gender types in data model too
* lastname mandatory relaxed? How about just mandatory that some part is defined since sorting isn't always on lastname first?
* More flexible sorting allowing arbitrary name part order?

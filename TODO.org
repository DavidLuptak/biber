* DONE biblatex firstinits option to giveninits
* DONE useprefix per names/name?
* DONE More flexible sorting allowing arbitrary name part order?
* DONE name taxonomy (first, middle, last) needs to be generalised. Internally in Biber too
** firstname -> given
** lastname -> family
** middlename -> middle
** prefix -> prefix
** suffix -> suffix
* DONE lastname mandatory relaxed? How about just mandatory that some part is defined since sorting isn't always on lastname first?
* DONE name parts and gender types in data model as constants
* DONE \keypart round \namepart
* DONE make namepart specs
** DONE named
** DONE selectable per sortlist
*** TODO abx@aux@sortscheme etc. probably this needs to be generalised to mentioned refcontexts
** DONE per-entry
** DONE per-namelist, per name
* DONE hashes use static construction from DM name constants - problem with uniquelist
* DONE tool mode bltx output should write schema but controlled by option (normal output uses same option)
* DONE per-names/name options are not in .bcf - matters?
* DONE per-namelists/per-name options
** DONE needs per names/name support in biblatex and in bbl
** DONE sortnamekeyscheme needs per entry/names/name in bbl
** DONE biblatex macro support in formats for sortnamekeyscheme
** DONE What to do with gender attribute on name?
* DONE Document example in biblatex manual of compound keypart
* DONE implement patronymic namepart example
* DONE Document year/month (datepart fields) are not allowed in bltxml
* DONE Sorting
** OM/GRT enhancememts?
** Some integer tests with <=>?
* DONE Transliteration interface
** Waiting for L::T release then make this a dep.
* DONE Year is missing for knuth:ct in sorting.t?
* DONE biblatexml.pm date parsing
* DONE BCE, circa etc.
** In bbl/bblxml output
*** year should be yearabs
*** new *dateera={beforecommonera/commonera} and these should be localisation strings
** datezeros needs to force zeros, not just assume, then testoutput again
* DONE biblatex output for date metadata
* DONE biblatex input for date metadata
* DONE enforce date field naming - where?
* DONE datezeros needs to force zeros
* DONE biblatex new test doc
* DONE docs - negs, explicit era versions, bce bool, locale strings, circa/uncertain format and bools
* DONE Test negative date sorting
* DONE Volume and ? to ints and remove padding?
* DONE Enforce year/month format as ints - sortyear should be int only and documented so. Enforce in biber (not datamodel as it's not part of that)
* DONE final sort elements copy string into all further fields which dies on int schema
* DONE Tune ...
* DONE Remove/convert fastsort?
* DONE Decomm RIS
* DONE Eras/circa/uncertain in cites
* DONE uniquename and initstrings etc. for xname should use DM and no explicit nameparts.
  ** Config.pm read for unt
  ** Document \DeclareUniquenameTemplate, add to release notes, add to XSLT
* DONE useprefix namelist and name scope with bibtex
* DONE LabelalphaNameTemplate implementation
** DONE .bcf read
** DONE config.pm opt read
** DONE compound, strwidth replace pstrwidth, pcompound and compound
** DONE xsl update
** DONE Doc - move pstrwidth (remove) -> strwidth, pcompound (remove) -> compound, strwidth on lant overrides on lat
* DONE sortgiveninits
** DONE Should be moved to option of \namepart in SNKS
** DONE Remove biber option and make biblatex deprecated
** DONE Fix in Internals, Remove from Constants.pm and Config.pm
** DONE Change schema, .bcfs, xsl, doc
* DONE giveninits should be autogen and <name>inits
** DONE Doc (including scope)
* DONE 'given' in _getnamehash_u in Internals - can be abstracted?
* DONE nullable_check in Biber.pm - needed? It's a deep loop
* DONE donames stuff is messy
* DONE hash/fullhash for all names
* TODO Implement EDTF Date/Times
** DONE circa/uncertain/era should apply to individual dates, not the range.
** DONE 5.2.5 - seasons - new field (not in DM, only from date parsing), containing localisation string
** DONE iso8601 -> EDTF in biblatex with fallback 
** DONE < year for CE/AD
** DONE Document *season and all label* new fields
** DONE cite in 96 is circa xxxx-yyyy instead of circa xxxx-circa yyyy
*** DONE Document mkday,month,yearzeros, changes
** DONE 5.2.2 - expand to ranges in biber and put in \Xdateuncertain{}
*** DONE biblatex unspec
*** DONE Document, remove 5.2.2 exclusion 96-test
** DONE Default for era
*** DONE edtf toggle can be removed (not tests - see below)
*** DONE Make a 'simple' option for dateera, default
*** TODO make a value for dateera that can be tested, perhaps usermode too
*** DONE convert edtf toggle tests to check for 'simple'
*** DONE This will need to be added to mkranges like labelname but for edtf, no choice as now
*** Doc, 96
** TODO times
*** DONE Option to decide TZ format (none, "EST", num). Get rid of "floating" in bbl
*** DONE timezeros option?
*** TODO option datetime like datelabel
*** TODO formats - 24hour, am/pm (localised), time sep (localised), leading zeros option for units
*** TODO \mktimezeros - needs options like mkdatezeros? probably not as each component is 2 digits
*** TODO Document *time= opts and formats, timelabel
* TODO bibtex output only works on bibtex input data as it uses ->rawfields - should be able to base it on biblatexml output
** TODO name to bib and name to xnamebib in Name.pm
** TODO date output to all formats needs to use raw because of 5.2.2 resolution. In general, dateparts should not be used to construct output

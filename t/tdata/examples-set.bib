    abstract = {Predictive coding is a procedure for transmitting messages which are
      sequences of magnitudes. In this coding method, the transmitter and
      the receiver store past message terms, and from them estimate the
      value of the next message term. The transmitter transmits, not the
      message term, but the difference between it and its predicted value.
      At the receiver this error term is added to the receiver prediction
      to reproduce the message term. This procedure is defined and messages,
      prediction, entropy, and ideal coding are discussed to provide a
      basis for Part II, which will give the mathematical criterion for
      the best predictor for use in the predictive coding of particular
      messages, will give examples of such messages, and will show that
      the error term which is transmitted in predictive coding may always
      be coded efficiently.},

    abstract = {In Part I predictive coding was defined and messages, prediction,
      entropy, and ideal coding were discussed. In the present paper the
      criterion to be used for predictors for the purpose of predictive
      coding is defined: that predictor is optimum in the information theory
      (IT) sense which minimizes the entropy of the average error-term
      distribution. Ordered averages of distributions are defined and it
      is shown that if a predictor gives an ordered average error term
      distribution it will be a best IT predictor. Special classes of messages
      are considered for which a best IT predictor can easily be found,
      and some examples are given. The error terms which are transmitted
      in predictive coding are treated as if they were statistically independent.
      If this is indeed the case, or a good approximation, then it is still
      necessary to show that sequences of message terms which are statistically
      independent may always be coded efficiently, without impractically
      large memory requirements, in order to show that predictive coding
      may be practical and efficient in such cases. This is done in the
      final section of this paper.},

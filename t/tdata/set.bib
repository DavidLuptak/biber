  ABSTRACT = {Predictive coding is a procedure for transmitting messages which are
    sequences of magnitudes. In this coding method, the transmitter and
    the receiver store past message terms, and from them estimate the
    value of the next message term. The transmitter transmits, not the
    message term, but the difference between it and its predicted value.
    At the receiver this error term is added to the receiver prediction
    to reproduce the message term. This procedure is defined and messages,
    prediction, entropy, and ideal coding are discussed to provide a
    basis for Part II, which will give the mathematical criterion for
    the best predictor for use in the predictive coding of particular
    messages, will give examples of such messages, and will show that
    the error term which is transmitted in predictive coding may always
    be coded efficiently.},

  ABSTRACT = {In Part I predictive coding was defined and messages, prediction,
    entropy, and ideal coding were discussed. In the present paper the
    criterion to be used for predictors for the purpose of predictive
    coding is defined: that predictor is optimum in the information theory
    (IT) sense which minimizes the entropy of the average error-term
    distribution. Ordered averages of distributions are defined and it
    is shown that if a predictor gives an ordered average error term
    distribution it will be a best IT predictor. Special classes of messages
    are considered for which a best IT predictor can easily be found,
    and some examples are given. The error terms which are transmitted
    in predictive coding are treated as if they were statistically independent.
    If this is indeed the case, or a good approximation, then it is still
    necessary to show that sequences of message terms which are statistically
    independent may always be coded efficiently, without impractically
    large memory requirements, in order to show that predictive coding
    may be practical and efficient in such cases. This is done in the
    final section of this paper.},

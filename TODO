TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
     take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.1)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)
   * xsl to pretty-print .bcf

     constraints should be able to be defined more than once for a type and then merged
     is DATE XOR YEAR really global?
     structure-constraints test
     ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
     Doc .rnc

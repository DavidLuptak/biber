TODO in decreasing order of priority:

* bltx middlename support made transparent in Name.pm
* Generalised \printbibliography system
* Zotero? http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/start
  https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items/<iTEMID>?key=<APIKEY>
  gives a parseable ATOM XML with the information in
* biblatex implements generalised crossref, related entries, structure defs
* When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
  take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.2)
* ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
* Generalised data/sorting options split to allow different e.g. sorting
  options to \printbibliography
* merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
  automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)

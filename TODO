TODO in decreasing order of priority:

* When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
  take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.2)
* Generalised \printbibliography system
  Typed lists - entry, key, shorthand etc.
  Take out MAIN, SHORTHANDS backwards compat hacks in Biber.pm and BBL.pm
  Shorthands should be requested otherwise it's a big sorting overhead
* bltx middlename support made transparent in Name.pm
* Zotero? http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/start
  https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items/<iTEMID>?key=<APIKEY>
  gives a parseable ATOM XML with the information in
* Structure ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
* merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
  automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.3)

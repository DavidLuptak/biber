TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * validate bibtex data with Text::Bibtex::Structure (optional) needs
     biblatex interface for defining structure of custom styles (biblatex 1.x)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 2.0)

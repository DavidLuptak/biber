TODO in decreasing order of priority:

* Take out labelalphatemplate defaults, optional in rnc/rng and parsing when biblatex implements it
* When cygwin on perl 5.14, change build script (deprecated module)
* When biblatex implements related entries, take out reprinttitle
* Generalised \printbibliography system
  Typed lists - entry, key, shorthand etc.
  Take out MAIN, SHORTHANDS backwards compat hacks in Biber.pm and BBL.pm
  Shorthands should be requested otherwise it's a big sorting overhead
* Structure ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
* Displaymodes should not be optional in schema and control parse when implemented
* Change Zotero driver when 2.2 comes out with real keys
* Zotero ATOM API? http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/start
  https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items/<ITEMID>?key=<APIKEY>
  gives a parseable ATOM XML with the information but it's ugly
  https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items?key=<APIKEY> give all entries
* uniquename needs changing everywhere if middlename is implemented

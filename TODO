ROADMAP / TODO

in decreasing order of priority:

   ----- version 0.5 ----- FIRST OFFICIAL RELEASE, in sync with biblatex 0.9
   * ==> make Biber::BibLaTeXML also take the nosort options into account
   * Implement options in LaTeX::Decode?
     ALTERNATIVELY: Upload an enhanced version of LaTeX::Decode to CPAN,
     and remove it from the Biber distribution.
   * Improve bib2biblatexml:
     - add print_biblatexml method to Biber::Internals and use it
     - add support for latest features in biblatexml-ml schema
   ----------
   * option --output-directory (https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=2876903)
   * add validation mechanism for options and config (untaint data),
     probably with Params::Validate
   * validate bibtex data with Text::Bibtex::Structure (optional)?
   * plugin facility
   * provide good documentation of the BibLaTeXML schema
   * refactor OO structure: add Biber::Conf and Biber::Entry classes ?
   * fix crossref handling of reviews
   * "D[onald] E. Knuth" prints as D. E. Knuth but is sorted with Donald E. Knuth ??
   * prototype of bbx style for handling multiscript bibliographies (will probably
        require xelatex+polyglossia or lualatex+(some-babel-equivalent)?)
   * PerlTeX integration ?
   * ...

TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
     take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.1)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)
   * validate bibtex data with Text::Bibtex::Structure (optional) needs
     biblatex interface for defining structure of custom styles (biblatex 2.x)

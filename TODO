TODO in decreasing order of priority:

* Take out labelalphatemplate defaults when biblatex implements it
* When cygwin on perl 5.14, change build script (deprecated module)
* When biblatex implements related entries, take out reprinttitle
* Generalised \printbibliography system
  Typed lists - entry, key, shorthand etc.
  Take out MAIN, SHORTHANDS backwards compat hacks in Biber.pm and BBL.pm
  Shorthands should be requested otherwise it's a big sorting overhead
* Structure ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
* Displaymodes should not be optional in schema and control parse when implemented
* Change Zotero driver when 2.2 comes out with real keys
* Zotero ATOM API? http://www.zotero.org/support/dev/start
  https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items/<ITEMID>?key=<APIKEY>
  gives a parseable ATOM XML with the information but it's ugly
  https://api.zotero.org/users/<USERID>/items?key=<APIKEY> give all entries



  #   1. If there is only one name and no prefix, first 3 chars of lastname
  #   2. If there is only one name with prefix, first char of prefix and first 2 chars of lastname
  #   3. If there is more than one name and name has no prefix, first char of each lastname
  #      (up to minnames)
  #   4. If there is more than one name and name has prefix, first char of prefix plus
  #      first char of each lastname (up to minnames)

  # Conditions on certain fields like *:prefix need another check to see if the relevant
  # option is defined (useprefix, for example)

  # Test for per-type labelalphatemplate

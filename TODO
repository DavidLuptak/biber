TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
     take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.1)
   * Document .rnc for .bcf
   * xsl to pretty-print .bcf
   * ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)

     Biber::Config->*data to Biber::Structure->methods?

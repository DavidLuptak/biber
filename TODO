TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
     take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.1)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)
   * Structure validation. Don't use Text::Bibtex::Structure as it's not so
     flexible - should operate on internal Biber structures. When there is
     an XML data format to replace .bib, such structure checking will be implemented
     as schema validation.
     Date format checking in Biber.pm (postprocess_dates()) should be moved to any
     general structure validation routine.
     postprocess_patents() needs to be done here too
     FIELD_ALIAS needs to be parameterised from structure
     process_structure entry types needs to be parameterised from structure

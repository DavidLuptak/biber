TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * add validation mechanism for options and config (untaint data),
     probably with Params::Validate
   * validate bibtex data with Text::Bibtex::Structure (optional) needs
     biblatex interface for defining structure of custom styles (biblatex 1.x)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 2.0)

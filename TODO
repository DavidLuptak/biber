ROADMAP / TODO

in decreasing order of priority:

   * for version 0.5.4, merge "bcfonly" branch into master for release. This
     implements the use of only .bcf and the one-pass, multi-section refs code.
   * add validation mechanism for options and config (untaint data),
     probably with Params::Validate
   * validate bibtex data with Text::Bibtex::Structure (optional) needs
     biblatex interface for defining structure of custom styles (biblatex 1.0)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 2.0)
   * make Biber::BibLaTeXML also take the nosort options into account
   * Implement options in LaTeX::Decode?
     ALTERNATIVELY: Upload an enhanced version of LaTeX::Decode to CPAN,
     and remove it from the Biber distribution.

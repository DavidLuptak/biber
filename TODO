TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * More intelligent data source extraction with cache
   * Generalised \printbibliography system
   * biblatex implements generalised crossref, related entries, structure defs
   * When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
     take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.2)
   * ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
   * Generalised data/sorting options split to allow different e.g. sorting
     options to \printbibliography
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)

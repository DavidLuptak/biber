TODO in decreasing order of priority:

   * When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
     take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.1)
   * merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
     automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.2)
   * Structure validation. Don't use Text::Bibtex::Structure as it's not so
     flexible - should operate on internal Biber structures. When there is
     an XML data format to replace .bib, such structure checking will be implemented
     as schema validation.

     constraints should be able to be defined more than once for a type and then merged
     ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
     make entrytype and field processing optional?

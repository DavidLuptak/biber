  gives a parseable ATOM XML with the information in
* biblatex implements generalised crossref, related entries, structure defs
* When biblatex implements interface and bcf for crossref inheritance,
  take out conditional in control file read and also change schema (biblatex 1.2)
* Structure ALL fields need to be put into types where possible
* merge in the "unique" branch to implement full uniquename/list
  automation. Needs new .bbl format and biblatex support (biblatex 1.3)

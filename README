    BIBER Version 0.4.2

==========================

Biber is a bibtex replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode-support.
It also introduces a new XML format (BibLaTeXML) for storing bibliographic
data, partly inspired by BibTeXML, but extended to account for the much richer
data model of biblatex, and much more. One major aim of the project is to make
multilingual and multiscript bibliographic management possible under a biblatex
environment.


REQUIREMENTS 

biber requires the following CPAN modules:
    
    * Readonly (but Readonly::XS is highly recommended)
    
    For parsing bibtex files, you need either 
    * Text::BibTeX (strongly recommended). 
      (NB: For Windows, ppm packages for Perl 5.8.* and 5.10.* are available on the biber 
      download page). >>> TODO <<<
    or
    * Parse::RecDescent 
      and
    * Regexp::Common
    
    * File::Slurp (for latex2utf8 or if converting bib files to UTF-8 with biber)
    
    For parsing data in the BibLaTeXML format, you'll need 
    * XML::LibXML 

    bib2biblatexml also requires
    * XML::Writer
    
    Optionally, if you want to place your xml files in a Berkeley DBXML container:
    * Sleepycat::DbXml 
     (see http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/xml/index.html)


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test         [optional]
	./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, biber --help will give you the basic documentation.

Biber also comes with two utility scripts:

    - bib2biblatexml : converts bib files to the BibLaTeXML format
    - latex2utf8     : converts LaTeX encoding to UTF-8

You can also find documentation for the included modules with the perldoc command:

    perldoc Biber
    perldoc LaTeX::Decode
    etc.

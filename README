    BIBER Version 0.5.5

==========================

Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode
support.  This release coincides with the release of biblatex 0.9b.

REQUIREMENTS

  These requirements only apply if you are installing the perl version.
  We also provide PAR::Packer generated binaries for many current OSes.

  Biber is written in Perl. Version 5.10 or higher is recommended. Be aware
  that if your version of Perl is older than that, Biber may work, but we
  won't be offering support. We strongly recommend version 5.10 or higher.

  In addition Biber requires a number of CPAN modules, which if missing
  should be automatically installed during the install process described
  below.

    * IPC::Cmd and IPC::Run (included in Perl 5.9.5 or higher)
    * File::Slurp::Unicode
    * Readonly (but Readonly::XS is highly recommended for performance reasons)
    * LaTeX::Decode (no longer bundled with Biber as it's on CPAN)
    * List::AllUtils (a wrapper for List::Util and List::MoreUtils)
    * Log::Log4perl
    * XML::LibXML::Simple (XML::LibXML clone of XML::Simple)
    * Text::BibTeX (requires Config::AutoConf when installing - please install this first.)

INSTALLATION

    ******************************************************************
    * THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE AND SO PATHS ARE VOLATILE, SO:
   
    First, delete your current biber installation perl tree by removing
    <perl site lib install path>/Biber

    *
    **************************************************************

  To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test         [optional but recommended]
    ./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

  After installing, biber --help will give you the basic documentation.

  Biber also comes with the utility script latex2utf8 to convert files with
  LaTeX encoding to UTF-8.

  You can also find documentation for the included modules with the perldoc command:

      perldoc Biber
      perldoc LaTeX::Decode
      etc.

CONFIG FILE

  Biber options can now be set in a configuration file. Biber will load the
  first file found among:
    - biber.conf (in the current directory)
    - $HOME/.biber.conf
    - $ENV{XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/biber/biber.conf (Unix/Linux/BSD with Gnome, KDE, etc)
    - $HOME/Library/biber/biber.conf" (Mac OSX only)
    - $ENV{APPDATA}/biber.conf" (Windows only)
    - the output of "kpsewhich biber.conf" (if available on the system).

  A sample config file is included in the source tarball under
    etc/biber.conf

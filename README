Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode
support.

REQUIREMENTS

  These requirements only apply if you are installing the perl version.
  We also provide PAR::Packer generated binaries for most common OSes.

  Biber is written in Perl. Version 5.12 is recommended if you are running
  the perl source version as it has the best Unicode implementation of any
  Perl version so far.

  In addition Biber requires a number of CPAN modules, which if missing
  should be automatically installed during the install process described
  below.

    * Unicode::Collate 0.68 or higher
    * IPC::Cmd and IPC::Run
    * File::Slurp::Unicode
    * Readonly (but Readonly::XS is highly recommended for performance reasons)
    * LaTeX::Decode
    * List::AllUtils
    * Log::Log4perl
    * XML::LibXML::Simple (XML::LibXML clone of XML::Simple)
    * Text::BibTeX (requires Config::AutoConf when installing - please install this first.)

INSTALLATION

  Binaries are available for most common architectures but if you wish
  to install the perl source version, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test         [optional but recommended]
    ./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

  After installing, biber --help will give you the basic documentation.
  The latest PDF documentation can be found here:

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/biblatex-biber/current/documentation/

  Biber also comes with the utility script latex2utf8 to convert files with
  LaTeX encoding to UTF-8.

  You can also find documentation for the included modules with the perldoc command:

      perldoc Biber
      perldoc LaTeX::Decode
      etc.

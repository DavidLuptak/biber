    BIBER Version 0.4.4

==========================

Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode-support.
This release occurs simultaneously with the release of v0.5, which supports
biblatex 0.9. Users of biblatex 0.8 shoud use this version instead.

REQUIREMENTS 

  Biber is written in Perl. Version 5.8.x or higher is recommended. Be aware
  that if your version of Perl is older than that, Biber may work, but we
  won't be offering support.

  In addition Biber requires a number of CPAN modules, which if missing
  should be automatically installed during the install process described
  below.

    * IPC::Cmd (included in Perl 5.9.5 or higher)
    * Readonly (but Readonly::XS is highly recommended for performance reasons)
    * List::AllUtils (a wrapper for List::Util and List::MoreUtils)
    * Log::Log4perl
    * XML::LibXML::Simple (XML::LibXML clone of XML::Simple)
    * File::Slurp (for latex2utf8 or if converting bib files to UTF-8 with biber).
    * Text::BibTeX (strongly recommended) OR
      Parse::RecDescent AND Regexp::Common

  ==> IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS <==
  Because the CPAN distribution of Text::BibTeX cannot be straightforwardly
  installed on Windows yet, users are urged to download and install a
  pre-compiled package for Text::BibTeX available on our sourceforge download
  page. Choose the link that corresponds to your version of Perl (5.8.x or
  5.10.x):
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/Text-BibTeX%20for%20windows/0.38/Text-BibTeX-0.38-perl-5.8.zip/download
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/Text-BibTeX%20for%20windows/0.38/Text-BibTeX-0.38-perl-5.10.zip/download
  Unzip the file, and follow the instructions in the file README.txt. (Note
  that versions for 64-bit Windows are not available at present.)


INSTALLATION

  To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test         [optional]
    ./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

  After installing, biber --help will give you the basic documentation.

  Biber also comes with the utility script latex2utf8 to convert files with
  LaTeX encoding to UTF-8.

  You can also find documentation for the included modules with the perldoc command:

    perldoc Biber
    perldoc LaTeX::Decode
    etc.

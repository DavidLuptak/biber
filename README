    BIBER Version 0.5.3

==========================

Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode
support.  This release coincides with the release of biblatex 0.9, the
first one that is likely to be integrated within the most popular TeX
distributions (TeX Live, MikTeX, etc.)


REQUIREMENTS

  Biber is written in Perl. Version 5.8.x or higher is recommended. Be aware
  that if your version of Perl is older than that, Biber may work, but we
  won't be offering support.

  In addition Biber requires a number of CPAN modules, which if missing
  should be automatically installed during the install process described
  below.

    * IPC::Cmd (included in Perl 5.9.5 or higher)
    * Readonly (but Readonly::XS is highly recommended for performance reasons)
    * List::AllUtils (a wrapper for List::Util and List::MoreUtils)
    * Log::Log4perl
    * XML::LibXML::Simple (XML::LibXML clone of XML::Simple)
    * File::Slurp (for latex2utf8 or if converting bib files to UTF-8 with biber).
    * Text::BibTeX (strongly recommended) OR
      Parse::RecDescent AND Regexp::Common

INSTALLATION

  To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test         [optional but recommended]
    ./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

  After installing, biber --help will give you the basic documentation.

  Biber also comes with the utility script latex2utf8 to convert files with
  LaTeX encoding to UTF-8.

  You can also find documentation for the included modules with the perldoc command:

      perldoc Biber
      perldoc LaTeX::Decode
      etc.

      http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net


CONFIG FILE

  Biber options can now be set in a configuration file. Biber will load the
  first file found among:
    - biber.conf (in the current directory)
    - $HOME/.biber.conf
    - $ENV{XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/biber/biber.conf (Unix/Linux/BSD with Gnome, KDE, etc)
    - $HOME/Library/biber/biber.conf" (Mac OSX only)
    - $ENV{APPDATA}/biber.conf" (Windows only)
    - the output of "kpsewhich biber.conf" (if available on the system).

  A sample config file is included in the source tarball under
    etc/biber.conf

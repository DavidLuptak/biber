* Change version string in and content of "Changes" file
* Change version string in doc
* Update "TODO" file
* Update main html and doc page and sync
  scp htdocs/*.html philkime,biblatex-biber@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/
* Change version string in "Biber.pm"
* Change beta version flag in "Biber.pm" if necessary
* Change $BIBLATEX_VERSION in Constants.pm to match appropriate biblatex
  version, if necessary.
* "perl Build.PL" and "Build dist" to update YAML
* Commit and tag with version number
* Build binaries from release and upload to SF, associate new defaults if necessary
* Update SF main page, news, add new README in web interface at root, if needed
* Update TL contrib with new binaries
  Don't forget that the TLcontrib main package (doc package) needs to be a

* Upload to CTAN
  Build dist then unpack and repack to .zip

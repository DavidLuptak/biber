Revision history for biber

0.4.2   15.4.2009
        * New option --inputencoding to handle 8-bit encoded bib files
        * $BIBINPUT environment is now searched
        * Improved parsing of personal names
        * @comments are now silently ignored
        * Warnings and errors behave more like BibTeX
        * Alias fields are automatically converted (e.g. address -> location)
        * bib2biblatexml has been improved
        * Cite keys of bib files are now case-insensitive
        * Default Unicode collation now uses the table "latinkeys.txt"
          (this is much faster than "allkeys.txt" which contains rules for 
          all Unicode glyphs)  
        * Unicode::Collate parameters can be passed as a command-line option
        * Even faster sorting (with option -f) is also possible for specific 
          locales given with option --locale (this is OS-dependent however)

        * Many bugfixes

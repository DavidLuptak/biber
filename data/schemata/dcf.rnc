        #    by the "handler" routine defined in the driver
        # 2. A name->aliasof mapping, saying that the data source "name" field should
        #    be mapped to the biblatex field "aliasof" which is in turn handled by
        #    an entry of type 1 above. This is used for field aliases which don't
        #    vary between entrytypes (i.e. are global aliases). This is the most
        #    common case. For field aliases which are entrytype specific (Endnote
        #    does this, for example), see type 3 below.
        # 3. A name->aliasof(+aliasfortype) mapping, giving multiple field mappings for
        #    "name". You can specifiy a global mapping like type 2 above by leaving out
        #    the "aliasfortype" attribute. You must use this form when you need to
        #    specifiy more than one alias mapping for the same name, meaning that
        #    you need to specify entrytype specific mappings. For example, if the "isbn"
        #    field in the data source maps to biblatex's "isbn" except when it's in a
        #    journal article entry and then it should map to biblatex's "issn", you need
        #    this form. This may seem like a stupid example but it's exactly what Endnote
        #    does in its XML format export. See the .dcf for the Endnote XML driver
